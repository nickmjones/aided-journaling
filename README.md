## Project Structure

```
src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx                 # Main app component
  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ JournalApp.jsx     # Main journal component
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/
  â”‚       â””â”€â”€ alert-dialog.jsx # ShadCN UI component
  â””â”€â”€ lib/
      â””â”€â”€ utils.js           # Utility functions for UI components
```

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Lucide React Icons

## Local Storage

The app uses localStorage to automatically save drafts. The following data is stored:
- Title
- Prompts
- Answers
- Lock states for prompts

Data is cleared from localStorage when an entry is successfully exported.

## File Naming Convention

Exported Markdown files follow this format:
`[optional-title]-DD-MMM-YYYY.md`

Example:
- With title: `morning-reflection-29-dec-2024.md`
- Without title: `29-dec-2024.md`
